## Getting Started:
To run the pipeline, please visit the directories and run the files in order:

`/scripts`

1. `download.py`: This downloads the raw data into the `data/raw` directory.

`/notebooks`

2. `preprocessing_notebook_part_1.ipynb`: This notebook performs **data linkage**, **outlier removal**, **filtering**, and outputs it to the `data/curated/full_data` directory.

3. `preprocessing_notebook_part_2.ipynb`: This notebook performs **aggregation** for analysis and modelling and outputs it to the `data/curated/analysis` and `data/curated/modelling` directories.

3. `data_analysis.ipynb`: This notebook is used to conduct **analysis** and **visualisation** on the curated data.

4. `model_analysis.ipynb`: This notebook is used for **training, analysing and discussing the models**.
